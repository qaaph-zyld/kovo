# KOVO Product Design Concept & Modularity System

## 1. Core Philosophy: The "DNK" (DNA) & Hybrid Modularity
KOVO is built on the premise of "Jedna platforma, više lica" (One platform, many faces). The entire system is derived from a strict set of standardized industrial components that combine to create premium wrought iron furniture targeting EN 581 contract-grade certification.

The system relies on **Hybrid Modularity**:
*   **Primary Structure (Welded):** Side frames are single welded assemblies (MIG/MAG welded, ground smooth). This provides the necessary structural integrity and stiffness that pure bolt-together systems lack.
*   **Secondary Connections (Bolted):** Cross-rails, seats, and backrests connect the primary welded frames. These are the flat-pack disassembly points.

### The Standardized Materials
*   **Main Structural Frame:** Kvadratna cev 25×25mm (Square steel tube 25x25mm). This provides the robust, architectural foundation for all load-bearing elements. S235JR steel profile.
*   **Secondary/Decorative Elements:** Traka 30×6mm (Flat steel bar 30x6mm) and solid steel rods. Used for backrests, armrests, and decorative scrolls.
*   **Wood Elements:** Solid oak (Hrast masiv) for table tops, seat panels, and bench planks. Finished for outdoor durability.

## 2. The Connection System (Sistem spojeva)
The genius of KOVO lies in its tool-free (or single-tool) assembly. No welding by the end-user.
*   **Internal Fastening:** Weld nuts (DIN 929) are welded *inside* the 25×25mm square tube during sub-assembly fabrication. The user simply threads a bolt from the outside into the concealed nut.
*   **The Hardware:** Standardized M8 and M10 Inox Hex bolts.
*   **The Alignment:** Ø6mm steel dowel pins (DIN 7) pressed into welded sub-assemblies mate with drilled holes in connecting parts. This ensures repeatable, precise assembly and prevents shear loading on the bolts.
*   **The Tolerance:** Slot holes (Slot rupe) are used instead of perfect circles to account for the thickness of powder-coating/paint, ensuring easy assembly.
*   **Universal Bolt Pattern:** All backrests use a fixed 4-bolt mounting pattern (4× M8 on an 80×120mm pitch circle) on the rear uprights.

## 3. Dimensional Grid & Modularity System
The entire KOVO system adheres to a strict **50mm dimensional grid**. All bolt hole spacing, adjustment increments, and component dimensions snap to this grid.

*   **The Base Module (450mm):** A single-seat width is defined as 450mm (9× the 50mm grid).
*   **Scaling:** A two-seat bench is 900mm (2x450mm), a three-seat bench is 1350mm. All backrests designed to this 450mm width module bolt onto any frame.

### A. Interchangeable Backrests (Zamenljivi nasloni)
The chair and bench bases are universal. The backrest panel is a separate 450mm module attached via the universal 4-bolt pattern.
*   **Klasik:** Traditional, ornate scrolls.
*   **Rešetka:** Modern, vertical geometric bars.
*   **Luk:** The signature sweeping LINEA arch.

### B. Universal Table Base (Univerzalna baza stola)
A single structural leg design that scales.
*   One standard leg module can support a Bistro top (Ø60cm) or be grouped in pairs/fours to support a Family dining top (160x90cm).
*   **Connection:** M10 hex bolts + flange plate (flanš pločica).

### C. Replaceable Wear Parts (Zamena drvenih delova)
The steel lasts a lifetime; the wood might not.
*   Seat panels and table tops are independently removable. A user can buy a new oak seat after 5 years without replacing the iron frame.

## 4. Dimensions & Ergonomics
*   **Dining Chair:** Seat height 45cm. Total height 85-90cm. Width 45cm (450mm base module).
*   **Bistro Table:** Height 75cm. Top Ø70cm or 70x70cm square.
*   **Family Table:** Height 75cm. Top 160x90cm or 200x100cm.
*   **Bench:** Seat height 45cm. Length 90cm (2-seat) or 135cm (3-seat).

## 5. Visual Identity & Inspiration
*   **Style:** "Warm Industrial" / "Precision Craft". It rejects both the overly ornate, dusty rustic ironwork of the past, and the cold, sterile tech-minimalism of modern aluminum furniture.
*   **The Signature Line:** The "LINEA" arch is a sweeping, continuous curve present in the backrests and table supports, softening the rigid 25x25mm square tubing.
*   **Finish:** "Iron-deep" powder coating with a slight texture (workshop gray/hammered effect), contrasting against the warm amber tones of finished oak.

### Design Inspiration (Existing Systems)
While KOVO applies this to heavy wrought iron, the *logic* is inspired by modern systematic design:
*   **USM Haller:** The ultimate modular furniture system based on a ball-and-tube node connection. KOVO takes the idea of a universal joint but applies it to flat-pack outdoor iron.
*   **IKEA (Democratic Design):** The flat-pack delivery and standardized tooling (the Allen key).
*   **Kettal / Gandia Blasco:** High-end outdoor furniture brands that use architectural metal frames contrasting with warm natural materials, focusing on thick, confident proportions rather than thin wireframes.
