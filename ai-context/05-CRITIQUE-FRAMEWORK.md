# CRITIQUE FRAMEWORK

> **Never ship first draft.**
> **Self-critique is how generic becomes professional.**
> **Be brutal. Be specific. Be iterative.**

---

## THE CRITIQUE MINDSET

Critique is not negativity. Critique is refinement.

Every design decision is a hypothesis. Critique tests it.

**Bad critique**: "I don't like it."
**Good critique**: "The CTA lacks visual weight because the surrounding whitespace creates competition."

---

## CRITIQUE TRIGGERS

Run critique after:
- ✅ Every component completion
- ✅ Every section completion
- ✅ Every page completion
- ✅ Before any "I'm done" statement
- ✅ After any "that looks good" thought

## THE 4-LEVEL CRITIQUE SYSTEM

### Level 1: Anti-Pattern Scan (30 seconds)
Fast check for obvious problems.

### Level 2: Constraint Check (2 minutes)
Verify alignment with tokens and brief.

### Level 3: Persona Evaluation (5 minutes)
Evaluate through persona lens.

### Level 4: Competitive Comparison (10 minutes)
Compare against reference sites.

## LEVEL 1: ANTI-PATTERN SCAN

### The "AI-Coded" Checklist

Check each item. If ANY are present, REWORK.

| Anti-Pattern | Present? | Action |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| `rounded-2xl` or `rounded-3xl` used liberally | ⬜ | Reduce to specified radius |
| Pastel gradient backgrounds | ⬜ | Replace with defined palette |
| Perfect 3-column feature card grid | ⬜ | Create varied layout |
| Centered hero with centered button | ⬜ | Add visual tension |
| Excessive whitespace (airy for no reason) | ⬜ | Increase density |
| Inter font (unless specified) | ⬜ | Use specified font |
| Soft shadows on everything | ⬜ | Apply shadow philosophy |
| All elements perfectly centered | ⬜ | Create intentional asymmetry |
| Generic "Get Started" CTA | ⬜ | Use specific action text |
| Placeholder-looking illustrations | ⬜ | Remove or replace |

### Quick Questions

1. **Does this look like a template?** If yes, what makes it look template-like?
2. **Can you guess the Tailwind classes?** If yes, it's too generic.
3. **Would this design appear on a "Top 10 SaaS Landing Pages" list?** If yes (and not in a good way), rework.

## THE BRUTAL QUESTIONS

After any critique level, ask these questions honestly:

### About Generic Feel
1. **What makes this look like AI-generated design?**
2. **Where does this resemble common startup templates?**
3. **What would a senior designer change immediately?**
4. **What makes this forgettable?**

### About Identity
5. **If the logo was removed, would this be recognizable?**
6. **What makes this uniquely [brand name]?**
7. **What personality does this design communicate?**
8. **Is that the intended personality?**

### About Conversion
9. **What's the ONE thing users should do?**
10. **Is that action immediately obvious?**
11. **What might prevent users from converting?**
12. **Where might users lose interest?**

### About Professionalism
13. **What looks "off" or amateur?**
14. **Where does spacing feel inconsistent?**
15. **What details feel unpolished?**
16. **Where does hierarchy break down?**

1. **Run Level 1 scan** - Quick anti-pattern check
2. **If any anti-patterns found** → Fix immediately
3. **Run Level 2 check** - Verify constraints
4. **If violations found** → Report and fix
5. **Run Level 3 evaluation** - Apply persona
6. **Document persona critiques** → Write specific feedback
7. **Decide on iteration** → Continue or proceed

### Before Marking Complete

1. **Run all 4 levels**
2. **Document all findings**
3. **Show comparison to references**
