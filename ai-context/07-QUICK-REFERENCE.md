## THE 5-PHASE WORKFLOW

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PHASE 1: ORIENTATION                              │
│  Read: Brief → Tokens → Personas                   │
│  Output: Understanding of what & why               │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PHASE 2: RESEARCH                                 │
│  Action: Analyze references, extract patterns      │
│  Output: Principles to apply                       │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PHASE 3: IMPLEMENTATION                           │
│  Action: Build with constraints                    │
│  Output: Draft component                           │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PHASE 4: CRITIQUE                                 │
│  Action: Run 4-level critique, iterate             │
│  Output: Refined component                         │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PHASE 5: DELIVERY                                 │
│  Action: Final check, document, deliver            │
│  Output: Professional result                       │

## THE THREE LAWS

| Law | Rule | Violation Consequence |
|-----|------|----------------------|
| 1 | Constraints Before Code | Delete and restart |
| 2 | Research Before Implementation | Generic output |
| 3 | Critique Before Completion | Amateur quality |

---

## ANTI-PATTERN RED FLAGS 🚨

If you see ANY of these, DELETE and rework:

| Pattern | Why Bad |
|---------|---------|
| `rounded-2xl` everywhere | Soft, generic |
| Pastel gradients | Dated, template-y |
| 3-column feature grid | SaaS cliché |
| Centered hero + button | Most common pattern |
| Inter font | Developer default |
| Excessive whitespace | Lazy design |
| "Get Started" CTAs | Generic copy |
| Logo trust bar | Template filler |

---

## PERSONA QUICK SELECT

| Brand Feel | Use Persona |
|------------|-------------|
| Technical, Premium | 🔧 Engineer + ✂️ Editor |
| Bold, Disruptive | ⚡ Agitator + 🎨 Artist |
| Clean, Trustworthy | ✂️ Editor + 🏛️ Architect |
| Creative, Artistic | 🎨 Artist + ⚡ Agitator |
| Enterprise, Serious | 🏛️ Architect + 🔧 Engineer |
| Friendly, Approachable | 🏠 Host + ✂️ Editor |

---

## CRITIQUE LEVELS

| Level | Time | What |
|-------|------|------|
| 1: Anti-Pattern | 30 sec | Check red flags |
| 2: Constraints | 2 min | Verify tokens |
| 3: Persona | 5 min | Apply lens |
| 4: Competitive | 10 min | Compare to refs |

---

## CONSTRAINT CATEGORIES

Always check:

```
□ Colors - Only from tokens
□ Spacing - Only from tokens  
□ Typography - Only from scale
□ Border Radius - Only from tokens
□ Shadows - Only from tokens
□ Motion - Only from tokens
```

---

## THE BRUTAL QUESTIONS

Ask after EVERY component:

1. **What makes this look AI-generated?**
2. **Where does this resemble templates?**
3. **What would a senior designer change?**
4. **If the logo was removed, is this recognizable?**
5. **What's the ONE action users should take?**

---

## COMMUNICATION TEMPLATES

### Missing Constraint
```
⚠️ CONSTRAINT MISSING
I need clarification on: [question]
Default would be: [default behavior]
Recommend you specify: [what would help]
```

### Conflict Detected
```
⚠️ CONSTRAINT CONFLICT
Token specifies: [value]
Brief suggests: [direction]
Which takes priority?
```

### Anti-Pattern Found
```
🚨 ANTI-PATTERN DETECTED
Pattern: [name]
Location: [where]
Replacement: [alternative]
```

- Color: Limited, high contrast
- Motion: Minimal, functional

### Premium/Minimal (Editor)
- Radius: 4-8px
- Spacing: Generous

## ITERATION MINIMUM

**Never ship first draft.**

| Component Type | Minimum Iterations |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Hero section | 3 |
| Feature section | 2 |
| Navigation | 2 |
| Footer | 2 |
| Form | 3 |
| Card components | 2 |

---

## FINAL CHECKLIST

Before saying "done":

```
□ All anti-patterns eliminated
□ All tokens used correctly
□ Persona alignment verified
□ Competitive quality matched
□ Critique documented
□ No "AI-coded" indicators
□ User's "hates" avoided
□ User's "loves" incorporated
□ Conversion action clear
□ Brand personality evident
```
