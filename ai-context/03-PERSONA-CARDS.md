## FOR AI: APPLYING PERSONAS

### When Starting a Project

1. **Read project brief** → Extract brand personality
2. **Map to persona** → Primary and secondary
3. **Adopt the voice** → Think like that persona
4. **Make decisions** → Through persona lens

### Example Application

```
Project Brief:
- Brand: Technical, Premium, Precise
- Emotional Goal: Confidence
- Visual Direction: Dense, sharp, professional

Persona Selection:
- Primary: The Engineer (technical precision)
- Secondary: The Editor (premium restraint)

Design Decisions:
- Border radius: 0-4px (Engineer: sharp edges)
- Spacing: Tight (Engineer: density)
- Typography: Technical, monospace accents (Engineer)
- Color: Limited, high contrast (Editor: restraint)
- Animation: Minimal, functional only (both)
```

### During Critique

Use persona voice when evaluating:

```
[Engineer Voice]:
"Why is this animation here? Does it serve a function?
This spacing is wasteful. Can we show more data here?
Why are we using rounded corners? Sharp is more precise."

[Editor Voice]:
"This section has too many elements. Cut three.
The CTA is competing with the content. Simplify.
What's the ONE thing we want them to see?"
```
